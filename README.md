show the details of each sandwich once it is selected.

## Significance of this Project

Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON
is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually
done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for  this project will
help you to better understand how it is processed.

## Learning through this project?
Through this project, the following points were grasped:
- How to submit projects for review
- Practice JSON parsing to a model object without using any third party library. 
- Design an activity layout using constraint layout.
- Populate all fields in the layout accordingly using Butterknife and databinding.
